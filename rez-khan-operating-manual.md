## 1. Working‑Style Snapshot

| Trait                     | What It Means in Practice                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep‑Focus Builder**    | At my best when I go heads‑down on thorny security/code problems for 2–4 h stretches. |
| **Novelty‑Fuelled**       | New challenges light me up; repetitive admin dulls my attention.                      |
| **Outcome‑Driven**        | Clear “Definition of Done” + metric beats process discussion every time.              |
| **Neurodivergent (ADHD)** | Calendar pings & rapid‑fire Slack threads can slip past unless they’re unmistakable.  |

## 2. Core Hours & Availability

| When (PT)                    | What I’m Doing                               | How to Reach Me                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **10 a.m.–2 p.m. (Mon–Fri)** | Deep‑work block (code, audits, design docs)  | *Asynchronous only* → GitHub issues / Linear tickets |
| **2 p.m.–3 p.m. (Mon–Thu)**  | Meeting / pair‑programming window            | Google Meet / Zoom (link in calendar invite)         |
| **3 p.m.–6 p.m.**            | Email & Slack triage, reviews, async updates | Slack thread / email                                 |
| **Outside those hours**      | Personal time, research, surf/martial arts   | Tag as **URGENT** (see Escalations)                  |

## 3. Communication Rules

1. **Primary channels**
   • *Project work* → GitHub / Linear
   • *Quick questions* → Slack (thread, not DM)
   • *Formal decisions* → Google Doc comment / Notion page
2. **Response SLA**
   • Standard: < 24 h weekdays
   • Urgent: tag `@rez NOW` **and** Whatsapp Phone → reply ≤ 60 min if awake
3. **Meetings**
   • One 30‑min weekly squad sync with agenda; decline others lacking purpose
4. **Preferred format**
   • Written > verbal; Loom > live demo

## 4. How to Help Me Help You

| Need                           | What You Can Do                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clear scope**                | Acceptance criteria, success metric & deadline up front     |
| **Timely feedback**            | Comment on PRs/docs within 48 h so momentum stays high      |
| **Minimise context switching** | Batch small asks into one ticket/doc review                 |
| **Signal urgency**             | Use `@rez NOW` or SMS; otherwise I assume standard priority |

---

## 5. What You Can Expect From Me

* **High‑quality security work** — thorough audits, repro steps, fix recs
* **Rapid prototypes** — V1 in days, not weeks
* **Written transparency** — daily GitHub/Linear updates & end‑of‑week summary
* **Respect for autonomy** — no micromanagement; assume same freedom

## 6. Motivation & Energy Management

| Fills My Tank                       | Drains My Tank                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Solving novel technical puzzles     | Endless status meetings               |
| Public scoreboards / hack‑days      | Slack pings with no context           |
| Surf & Filipino martial‑arts breaks | Vague requirements, shifting goals    |
| Tight deadlines with clear impact   | Long email chains asking for opinions |

If my energy dips, a 15‑min brainstorm on the bigger *why* usually re‑ignites me.

## 7. Escalation Ladder

1. Tag `@rez NOW` in Slack

Know this when routing opportunities or collaborations.

## 9. “Parking Lot” Topics

I keep a running list of interesting ideas that aren’t for this season. If I park your idea, it’s not *no*—just *not now*. Remind me next season.
